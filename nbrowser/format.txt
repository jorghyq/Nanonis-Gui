quality:  1:    very good, almost all features visible
          2:    good, single tip
          3:    good and bad mixed
          4:    double or multiple tip, but clear image
          5:    double or triple tip and low quality
          6:    blurry, maybe there is something
          7:    really bad, almost no meaningful features

type:    1:    few molecules or molecular structure
         2:    molecular islands
         3:    molecules spread over surface
         4:    molecular islands and >50% metal
         5:    molecules spread over surface and >50% metal
         6:    most metal, some G or BN
         7:    most graphene or BN
         8:    nothing resolvable


flatness 1:    perfectly flat
         2:    2 step edges < 2
         3:    2 < step edges < 5
         4:    5 < step edges, but still resolvable
         5:    too rough

cleanness: 1:   very clean
           2:   dirts < 20%
           3:   20% < dirts < 50%
           4:   50% < dirts
